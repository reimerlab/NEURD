"""
Purpose: to map out the functions
that need to be implemented for
proximity to work

"""

Functions to implement in vdi
1) segment_id_to_synapse_table_optimized_connectome
    a. get all the synapses between 2 segments that have been proofread

Has a lot of information on compartment of synapses for both pre and post


2) segment_id_to_synapse_table_optimized: 
gets the presyn synapse df

3) segment_id_to_synapse_table_optimized_proofread

gets all the presyn synapses from proofread table

4) soma_nm_coordinate


5) graph_obj_from-proof_stage:
    a. gets the graph object

6) fetch_proofread_mesh

7) postsyn_soma_mesh = vdi.fetch_soma_mesh


# --- in the proximity function
8) pre_post_synapse_ids_coords_from_connectome
